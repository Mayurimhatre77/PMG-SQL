-->Question #1 Generate a query to get the sum of the clicks of the marketing data​


SELECT
    SUM(clicks) AS total_clicks
FROM
    marketing_data;
	
	
	

-->Question #2 Generate a query to gather the sum of revenue by store_location from the store_revenue table​

SELECT
    store_location,
    SUM(revenue) AS TOTAL_REVENUE
FROM
    store_revenue
GROUP BY
    store_location;
	
	
	
	
-->Question #3 Merge these two datasets so we can see impressions, clicks, and revenue together by date and geo. Please ensure all records from each table are accounted for.​

	
SELECT S.DATE, S.STORE_LOCATION,S.REVENUE,S.BRAND_ID,M.*
FROM store_revenue S
FULL OUTER JOIN marketing_data M
ON S.DATE = M.DATE
AND SUBSTR(S.STORE_LOCATION,-2) = M.GEO
ORDER BY M.DATE
;


-->Question #4 In your opinion, what is the most efficient store and why?​

As seen in the output of question 2, the revenue generated by the store 'United States-CA' is the most.
Even though it has two brands, it still has the highest revenue among others. Hence, this store is the most efficient one. 


-->Question #5 (Challenge) Generate a query to rank in order the top 10 revenue producing states​

SELECT
    store_location,
    total_revenue
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            store_location,
            SUM(revenue) total_revenue
        FROM
            store_revenue
        GROUP BY
            store_location
        ORDER BY
            SUM(revenue) DESC
    )
WHERE
    ROWNUM <= 10;
